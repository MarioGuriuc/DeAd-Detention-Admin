# DeAd-Detention-Admin

My friend and I developed a web application to streamline the management of visits for inmates in correctional facilities. The system allows administrators to record visitor details, including identity, photo, relationship to the inmate (like family or attorney), and the purpose of each visit.

It also tracks visit-specific information such as date, duration, purpose, items exchanged, and any summary of the discussions (respecting confidentiality rules). Additionally, health and mental state notes, along with any witness information, can be recorded.

The application generates detailed reports in HTML, CSV, and JSON formats, which can be filtered by inmate, time period, or type of offense. Essential features are also accessible via a REST API for broader integration.
