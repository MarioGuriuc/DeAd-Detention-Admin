        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The primary objective of this document is to delineate the comprehensive requirements and specifications
                for the design and development of a sophisticated web-based application tailored for the efficient
                management of visitation processes within correctional facilities, encompassing both prisons and
                correctional homes. This advanced application aims to offer a robust suite of features to meticulously
                record, manage, and analyze visitor interactions, ensuring transparency, security, and adherence to
                established protocols.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

                </li>
                <li>Empower authorized personnel with robust reporting tools to generate in-depth statistical reports,
                    offering valuable insights into visitation trends, patterns, and behaviors over specified time
                    periods, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and policy formulation.
                </li>
                <li>Implement a secure, user-friendly interface accessible via standard web browsers on various
                    computing devices, ensuring widespread accessibility while maintaining stringent security measures
                    to safeguard sensitive data and protect user privacy.

            <h2>System Features</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>
                    Docker Containerization
                </h3>
                <section>
                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization that involves
                        encapsulating an application in a container with its own operating environment. Docker is a
                        popular containerization platform that allows developers to build, ship, and run applications
                        within containers.</p>
                    <p>The detention administration system will be containerized using Docker to ensure consistency,
                        portability, and scalability across different environments. This will enable the system to be
                        easily deployed and managed in various settings, including development, testing, and production
                        environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Docker containers will encapsulate the application code, dependencies, and configuration
                        settings, providing a self-contained environment for the system to run without interference from
                        external factors. This approach enhances system reliability, security, and performance while
                        simplifying the deployment process for administrators and developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Docker Compose will be used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications, allowing
                        the detention administration system to be composed of multiple services, such as the web server,
                        database, and API server. This will streamline the deployment and orchestration of the system
                        components, ensuring seamless integration and operation of the application.
                    </p>
                </section>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Backend and Database</h2>

            <p>The backend of the application is developed using PHP, a server-side scripting language known for
                its versatility and ease of integration. PHP will handle the logic of the application, including data
                processing, authentication, and communication with the database.</p>
            <p>
                The architecture of the backend is based on microservices, each service being responsible for a specific
                aspect of the application, such as user management, visitation records, or statistical reporting. This
                modular approach allows for greater flexibility, maintainability, and scalability, as each service can
                be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
            </p>

            <p>For the database management system, MongoDB will be utilized. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers
                flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for storing and managing the diverse data structures
                associated with visitation records. It provides features such as document-based storage, dynamic
                schemas, and high availability, which are advantageous for the requirements of the detention
                administration website.</p>
