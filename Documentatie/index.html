        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The primary objective of this document is to delineate the comprehensive requirements and specifications
                for the design and development of a sophisticated web-based application tailored for the efficient
                management of visitation processes within correctional facilities, encompassing both prisons and
                correctional homes. This advanced application aims to offer a robust suite of features to meticulously
                record, manage, and analyze visitor interactions, ensuring transparency, security, and adherence to
                established protocols.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>Specifically, the application will be designed to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Accurately capture and store detailed information about visitors, including their personal details,
                    contact information, photographic identification, and relationship status with the incarcerated
                    individual.
                </li>
                <li>Systematically record comprehensive visitation data, encompassing essential details such as
                    visitation dates, duration, nature of the visit, items exchanged during the visit, summaries of
                    discussions, and evaluations of the inmate's health and mood during the interaction.
                </li>
                <li>Facilitate seamless integration of visitor and inmate records, enabling administrators to
                    efficiently manage and associate visitors with specific inmates, ensuring proper tracking and
                    monitoring of all visitation activities.
                </li>
                <li>Empower authorized personnel with robust reporting tools to generate in-depth statistical reports,
                    offering valuable insights into visitation trends, patterns, and behaviors over specified time
                    periods, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and policy formulation.
                </li>
                <li>Implement a secure, user-friendly interface accessible via standard web browsers on various
                    computing devices, ensuring widespread accessibility while maintaining stringent security measures
                    to safeguard sensitive data and protect user privacy.

            <h2>Backend and Database</h2>

            <p>The backend of the application is developed using PHP, a server-side scripting language known for
                its versatility and ease of integration. PHP will handle the logic of the application, including data
                processing, authentication, and communication with the database.</p>

            <p>For the database management system, MongoDB will be utilized. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers
                flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for storing and managing the diverse data structures
                associated with visitation records. It provides features such as document-based storage, dynamic
                schemas, and high availability, which are advantageous for the requirements of the detention
                administration website.</p>
