  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a web application for managing visits received by individuals sentenced to serve time in a correctional facility, whether it be a prison or a correctional home. The application will provide functionality to record visitor details, visit information, and generate statistical reports for analysis.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>The application will allow authorized personnel to record and manage visitation data efficiently. It will facilitate the entry and retrieval of information related to visitors, including their identity, photograph, relationship with the inmate, nature of the visit, and associated details. Additionally, the application will generate statistical reports to analyze visitation trends and patterns over time.</p>
